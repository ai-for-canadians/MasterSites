## Quality Improvements

### Better Taglines
Each new site has a compelling, benefit-focused tagline:
- "Evidence on substances science forgot"
- "What your symptoms actually mean"
- "Scripts for the talks you've been avoiding"
- "Cut through the AI hype"

### Enhanced "Who It's For" Descriptions
More relatable, conversational language:
- "Anyone who has ever Googled a symptom at 2am and spiraled into WebMD terror"
- "Anyone who has ever rehearsed a conversation 47 times and still fumbled it"
- "Anyone who's uncomfortable with how much big tech knows about them (so... everyone)"

### Better Feature Lists
More specific, actionable features:
- "Red flag warnings (when to get help now)"
- "Copy-paste conversation scripts"
- "Honest capability assessments"
- "Privacy audit checklist"

## Technical Status

✅ All 8 new sites added to sites.ts
✅ Featured status updated correctly
✅ Site IDs renumbered sequentially (1-23)
✅ Category distribution correct
✅ TypeScript types valid
✅ 32 static pages generated (23 site pages + other routes)

⚠️ Pre-existing build warning: `/sites` page needs Suspense boundary for useSearchParams (not blocking, page still generates)

## Next Steps

To complete the hub update:
1. Fix the Suspense boundary warning in `/sites/page.tsx`
2. Update any analytics/tracking to reflect new site count
3. Consider updating the homepage stats (if shown)
4. Test all new site detail pages work correctly

## Impact

This update transforms the InfoBank Hub from a small directory into a compelling catalog of high-value, differentiated resources. The new sites fill critical gaps and provide unique value propositions that stand out from existing generic resources.

**Previous state:** 15 sites, generic positioning
**Current state:** 23 sites, differentiated value propositions, compelling taglines
